# ‚úÖ Cloud Security Module - Theory Sections Complete

## üìö **All 12 Labs Now Have Comprehensive Theory Sections**

### **Labs Enhanced with Theory:**

---

## 1. ‚ö° **Serverless Security Lab**
### Theory Added:
- Serverless architecture benefits & challenges
- Expanded attack surface (event-driven triggers)
- New attack vectors (event injection, Denial of Wallet)
- Monitoring challenges in ephemeral environments
- Best practices for function security

**Key Points:**
- Each function is an entry point
- No persistent security agents
- Cost attacks via infinite loops
- Event injection vulnerabilities

---

## 2. üîç **CSPM Lab (Cloud Security Posture Management)**
### Theory Added:
- Why CSPM is critical (95% breaches from misconfig)
- Core capabilities (detection, compliance, remediation)
- Common misconfigurations statistics
- CSPM vs CWPP vs CASB vs CIEM comparison
- Implementation strategy (5 phases)

**Key Statistics:**
- 73% have exposed storage buckets
- 65% have overly permissive network rules
- 58% have excessive IAM permissions
- 45% missing encryption

---

## 3. üõ°Ô∏è **CWPP Lab (Cloud Workload Protection Platform)**
### Theory Added:
- Evolution from endpoint to cloud-native protection
- Core components (hardening, runtime, network, container)
- Workload types & specific risks table
- Attack detection methods (signature, behavioral, ML)
- CWPP vs CSPM comparison

**Protection Focus:**
| Workload | Key Risks | Protection |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| VMs | Malware | AV, hardening |
| Containers | Escape | Runtime, scanning |
| Serverless | Event injection | Input validation |
| K8s | RBAC | Policy, segmentation |

---

## 4. üåê **API Gateway Security Lab**
### Theory Added:
- Why API gateways are critical (83% of web traffic)
- OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023) - complete list
- Common API threats (BOLA, excessive data exposure)
- Gateway security features (auth, rate limiting, WAF)
- Implementation patterns (Edge, BFF, Service Mesh)

**OWASP API Top 10:**
1. Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)
2. Broken Authentication
3. Broken Object Property Level Authorization
4. Unrestricted Resource Consumption
5. Broken Function Level Authorization
...and 5 more

---

## 5. üíæ **Data Security Lab**
### Theory Added:
- Data security in 3 states (rest, transit, use)
- Common data breach types & causes
- DLP components (discovery, classification, monitoring)
- Encryption key management strategies (CMK, BYOK, HYOK)
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

**Data Protection Matrix:**
| State | Protection | Technologies |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| At Rest | Encryption | AES-256, TDE, HSM |
| In Transit | TLS/VPN | TLS 1.3, mTLS, IPSec |
| In Use | Confidential | SGX, Homomorphic, Tokenization |
