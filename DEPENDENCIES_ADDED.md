## âœ… Installation Status

All packages have been successfully installed and tested:
- âœ… JWT module imports correctly
- âœ… Scapy module imports correctly  
- âœ… All refactored security labs import without errors
- âœ… Main application runs successfully

## ðŸš€ Usage

To install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To verify installation:
```bash
python -c "import jwt, scapy.all, defusedxml.ElementTree; print('All security modules ready!')"
```

## ðŸ“‹ Lab Coverage

The enhanced dependencies enable comprehensive coverage of:
- **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities
